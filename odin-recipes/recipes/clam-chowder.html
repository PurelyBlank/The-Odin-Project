        Ingredients
    </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cubed potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup diced carrots</li>
            <li>1 cup diced celery</li>
            <li>1 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>3 (6.5 ounce) cans minced clams, drained with juice reserved</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
            <li>3/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 quart half-and-half cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes, carrots, celery, and 
                onion into a large skillet; pour in 
                clam juice and add enough water to cover. 
                Cook and stir over medium-low heat until 
                vegetables are tender. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt butter in a large, heavy 
                saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in 
                flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and 
                stir constantly until thick and smooth. 
                Stir in vegetable mixture with any juices 
                until just heated through. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in clams just before serving. If they 
                cook too much they get tough. When clams 
                are heated through, stir in vinegar and 
                season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
        </ol>
