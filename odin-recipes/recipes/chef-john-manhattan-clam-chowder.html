        <p>
            Manhattan clam chowder is usually very watery, too tomato-y, 
            and not nearly clammy enough so I reworked the recipe into 
            something significantly more rich, satisfying, and delicious. 
            My secrets? A ton of clams, not too much tomato, and a 
            little bit of flour to thicken things up. Serve with oyster 
            crackers and garnish with fresh chives, parsley, tarragon, 
            or even dill, if desired.

            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup bottled clam juice</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 medium carrots, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 ribs celery, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>Â½ cup diced Italian tomatoes</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 pinches cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>3 cups peeled, diced Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Drain baby and chopped clams. Reserve liquid 
                in the refrigerator until needed and set clams aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place bacon in a soup pot over medium-high heat; 
                cook and stir until well-browned and almost crispy, 
                7 to 10 minutes. Add onion, garlic, and a pinch of salt; 
                cook and stir until onions start to soften and 
                turn translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Add tomato paste; cook and stir for 2 minutes. Don't 
                worry if some of the tomato paste sticks to the bottom 
                of the pot; we want that to happen. Sprinkle in flour; 
                cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Dump in reserved clam juice plus bottled clam juice and 
                chicken broth. Stir with a spatula, scraping the bottom 
                of the pot to deglaze any caramelization. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add carrots, celery, clams, diced tomatoes, pepper, 
                and cayenne; stir and bring to a boil. Reduce heat 
                to medium-low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, skimming 
                off some bacon fat if desired. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add diced potatoes and cook until tender but not falling 
                apart, about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust for salt, 
                if needed. Stir in fresh tarragon and parsley just before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
